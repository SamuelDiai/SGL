This repository contains the work of Paul Martin and Samuel Diai for the Project 6.8 of the Course "Time Series Learning" of Laurent Oudre.
On this project, we studied a novel approach to learn a structured Graph with Laplacian constraints.
The work is adapted from the article "Structured Graph Learning via Laplacian Spectral
Constraints" of Sandeep Kumar, Jiaxi Ying, Jose Vinicius de M. Cardoso and Daniel P. Palomar.

The repository contains : 
* The code of the Structured Graph Learning algorithm (SGL)
* Some tests made on very simple datasets (two moons, circles and blops) - basic_experiments.py
* An experiment on an animal dataset - animals..py
* An experiment on a cancer genome dataset - cancer.py
* A notebook where we do the above experiments and plot the results.
* A notebook where we apply the SGL algorithm to timeseries data. It is directly adapted from the assignment nÂ°6 of the course "Time Series Learning" by Charles Truong.
* The final report of our project.
